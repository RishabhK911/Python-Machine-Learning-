Basically there are two types of recommendation models : Content based & Collabrative based .
Content based models helps in fiding itmes similar to the ones already bought .
Collabrative based are of two types user-user type and item-item based .

We will be using LightFm Hybrid based model which is the combination of both , we will perform two tasks:

1. Recommand user a movie based on his/her past likings .
2. Recommand a list of users that might like a particula rmovie based on user features.
